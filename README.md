This project is called "Express Server" for module NODE101.

The goal of this project was to accomplish the following:

1. Create a new server using the Express framework
2. Log all incoming requests with the morgan logging library
3. Serve the Top Spots project from the web server
4. Serve the Top Spots data from the web server
5. Update your Top Spots front end with your new back end

Clone the repository locally to your computer. Open up the project in Visual Studio Code. Open up Terminal, run the command "npm start" //This will load the project into the web browser. Once the server is live, go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see a message displayed on the website that says "New Express Server". Afterwards, go to http://localhost:3000/data to view all of the contents inside of DATA JSON file. Lastly, to bring down the server, simply go to the Terminal and do "Ctrl + C" to take down the localhost server.
